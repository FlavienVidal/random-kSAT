# random-kSAT
Boolean Satisfiability Problem


If you look at random 4-SAT problems (problems with L clauses, N variables and each clause has exactly 4 literals) and you look at the probability that the 4-SAT problem is SAT or UNSAT according to the density of clauses. 
Transit-ion: the larger is the number of variables the shaper the sat-unsat phase transition (from SATisfaction to unsatisfaction) is.
